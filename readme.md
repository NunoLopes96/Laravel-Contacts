<b>Instalation:</b>

Configure the following lines in the `.env` file.

<ul>
    <li>DB_CONNECTION</li>
    <li>DB_HOST</li>
    <li>DB_PORT</li>
    <li>DB_DATABASE</li>
    <li>DB_USERNAME</li>
    <li>DB_PASSWORD</li>
</ul>

run `php artisan key:generate` & `php artisan migrate:install`
<p>Then we need to install dependencies:</p>
<p>Make sure you have composer and npm installed in your system.</p>

run `npm run prod` (production) or `npm run dev` (development)

run `composer install`

To have a fast server running, without copy/moving files, laravel has a useful command:
`php artisan serve`
then you can testing the application in `http://localhost:8000`

<b>Features:</b>
<p>Backend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each user will have his contacts.</li>
    <li>Users can't edit/view/update or delete other's contacts.</li>
    <li>Data is validated in Requests before going to the database, showing error message if the data was invalid.</li>
    <li>Success messages if a create/update/delete was successful</li>
    <li>Added Feature and Unit tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frontend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>External library added for a verification and adding country code to phone number in real time with auto-format.</li>
    <li>Validation of the Inputs with HTML5.</li>
    <li>Confirmation in the List View if the user really wants to delete a contact.</li>
    <li>Small validation that disables the Create/Update button if there was no changes in the form or it is still empty.</li>
</ul>

What is missing:
<ul>
    <li>Form Validation should still be disabled if the field is invalid.</li>
    <li>The views/layout structure could be improved.</li>
    <li>JS tests.</li>
</ul>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
